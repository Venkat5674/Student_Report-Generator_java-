  - "Build with iText" - Runs the build script to download iText
  - "Compile Only" - Compiles without running
  - "Clean" - Removes compiled classes

## Application Workflow

1. **Startup**: The application loads on launch, deserializing any saved student data
2. **Main Interface**: Displays a list of students and control buttons
3. **Student Management**:
   - Add Student: Create new student records with personal information
   - Edit Student: Modify existing student information
   - Delete Student: Remove students from the system
4. **Subject Management**:
   - Add subjects with names and marks
   - Calculate grades automatically
5. **Attendance Tracking**:
   - Record attendance status for specific dates
   - View attendance statistics
6. **Report Generation**:
   - Select a student and generate a report
   - Choose between text or PDF format
   - Save the report to a file
   - Option to open the report after generation

## Data Persistence

Student data is serialized and saved to a file named "students.ser" in the application directory. This file is automatically loaded when the application starts, ensuring data persistence between sessions.

## PDF Export Functionality

### Implementation Details
- The application uses the iText library (version 5.5.13.3) for PDF generation
- If iText is not available, a fallback mechanism creates a formatted text file with .pdf extension
- The build script offers to download iText automatically
- PDF reports include:
  - Formatted student information
  - Subject table with marks and grades
  - Attendance statistics
  - Overall average and grade

### PDF Generation Process
1. PdfExporter creates a Document object
2. Adds title and sections with formatted text
3. Creates tables for subjects with proper styling
4. Adds attendance information and statistics
5. Includes generation date in footer
6. Offers to open the generated PDF

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Windows environment (for .bat scripts)

### First-Time Setup
1. Run `build.bat` to compile the application and set up dependencies
2. When prompted, choose whether to download the iText library
3. Wait for compilation to complete

### Regular Use
1. Run `run.bat` to start the application
2. The main interface will appear with student management options
3. Use the interface to manage students and generate reports

### Using VS Code
1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P
3. Type "Tasks: Run Task" and select it
4. Choose "Build with iText" for first-time setup
5. Choose "Compile and Run" for regular use

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

1. **Data Import/Export** - Support for CSV or Excel formats
2. **Data Visualization** - Charts and graphs for student performance
3. **Batch Processing** - Generate reports for multiple students at once
4. **Advanced PDF Templates** - Customizable report layouts
5. **User Authentication** - Login system for different user roles
6. **Database Integration** - Replace serialization with database storage
7. **Cloud Backup** - Automatic backup of student data
8. **Multilingual Support** - Interface in multiple languages

## Development Notes

- The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture
- Java Swing components use BorderLayout and GridBagLayout for responsive UI
- Error handling includes user-friendly messages
- The code includes comments for maintainability
- PDF export gracefully degrades if iText is unavailable

## Deployment Options

### 1. JAR File Deployment

The simplest way to deploy this Java Swing application is by creating an executable JAR file:

1. **Create a JAR file with dependencies**:
   ```bat
   mkdir -p META-INF
   echo "Main-Class: view.StudentReportGeneratorApp" > META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
   jar cvfm StudentReportGenerator.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -C bin . -C lib .
   ```

2. **Distribute the JAR file**:
   - Package the JAR file along with a simple batch file to run it:
     ```bat
     @echo off
     java -jar StudentReportGenerator.jar
     ```
   - Users only need Java installed to run the application

### 2. Native Installer

Create platform-specific installers using tools like:

1. **Launch4j + Inno Setup (Windows)**:
   - Use Launch4j to wrap the JAR into a Windows executable (.exe)
   - Use Inno Setup to create a full installer that includes:
     - The wrapped executable
     - Required libraries (JRE and iText)
     - Shortcuts and registry entries
     - Uninstaller

2. **jpackage (JDK 14+)**:
   - Use the jpackage tool included in newer JDK versions:
   ```bat
   jpackage --input . --main-jar StudentReportGenerator.jar --main-class view.StudentReportGeneratorApp --name "Student Report Generator" --app-version 1.0 --vendor "YourCompany" --win-dir-chooser --win-menu --win-shortcut
   ```

### 3. Web Deployment with Java Web Start (Legacy)

For organizations with Java Web Start infrastructure:

1. Create a JNLP file describing the application
2. Sign the JAR files with a trusted certificate
3. Host the files on a web server
4. Users launch via browser or JNLP shortcut

### 4. Portable Application

Create a completely self-contained version:

1. Package the application with a minimal JRE using jlink
2. Include all dependencies and configuration
3. Create a portable ZIP or folder that needs no installation

### Deployment Checklist

- Ensure all dependencies are included or downloaded during installation
- Create a proper uninstaller if using an installer package
- Include user documentation and help files
- Test deployment on clean systems with different Java versions
- Consider auto-update functionality for future versions
- Ensure proper error logging for troubleshooting deployed instances
